Documentation for nimbleShop is under <ins>doc</ins> directory in the Github repo. Follow [the README][1] to build the documentation.

nimbleShop uses [Travis ci][2] as continuous integration (CI) server. However documentation changes do not require tests to be run. To help Tavis team keep the cost low you are encourage to add  [ci skip] to your documentation commit message to skip running tests for that commit.
